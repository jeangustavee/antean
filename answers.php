        <button class="accordion">What is your favorite typeface</button>
<div class="panel">
  <p><b>Jean.</b> At the studio, we like everything that is simple. We always try to go with the easy-to-read typefaces for many reasons. But, I can say that ARIAL is our favorite because it has a lot to do with our brand guideline.</p>

<button class="accordion">How do you define the studio style?</button>
<div class="panel">
  <p><b>Jean.</b> We try to stay away from the corporate system as much as we can. Antean Studios is a creative space. In order to be more productive we have to use the studio with an artistic feel. We like the space super-clean with as much light and optimism as possible. We try to keep space for big physical projects and little moments of rainbow-color to keep the work-vibe fun.</p>

<button class="accordion">What inspires you guys?</button>
<div class="panel">
  <p><b>Jean.</b> We inspire each other. The desire to succeed inspires us as well. Other than that, good conversation about design takes us to a whole other level.</p></div>

<button class="accordion">What is your favorite element at the studio?</button>
<div class="panel">
  <p><b>Jean.</b> The chill-out room also known as "The AC Room". It's where we are being more productive because it was specially designed for that.

        <button class="accordion">Is it challenging to find projects in Jacksonville?</button>
<div class="panel">
  <p><b>Jean.</b> Yes and No. Most Jacksonville companies don't have the culture of assigning a whole project to just one design firm. They would break it down and assign it to multiple entities. On top of that, the city is more corporate than creative. If you are looking to just create business cards, logos and build websites; the answer is yes. However, if you want to get very creative and are looking for projects, it can be very challenging.

        <button class="accordion">How do you find clients?</button>
<div class="panel">
    <p><b>Jean.</b> Technically, we operate in a way that makes it easy for clients to find us. Chasing clients is never an easy job. We position ourself in a way where it is very easy for clients to know about us.</p>

        <hr>
        <button class="accordion">Have you ever had to turn away projects?</button>
<div class="panel">
  <p><b>Jean.</b> Yes. Not all projects are worth putting your hands on. The client's personality is very important. I remember before Antean Studios I had to turn down a project and it happened to be for one of my friends. </p>
        </div>
        
        <hr>
        <button class="accordion">Do you guys do everything in-house?</button>
<div class="panel">
    <p><b>Jean.</b> Yes. That was one of our goals. Most design firms would outsource their projects. Us, --we like to get very involved. Since we are a small studio, we are forced to work with partners and other freelancers, but they are all based in Jacksonville. Most of the time they come to our studio and we are still very involved. We always make sure we communicate every little details with the client.</p>

        <button class="accordion">What is the structure of Antean Studios?</button>
<div class="panel">
    <p><b>Jean.</b> It is a very good place to be. Nobody has an office. It is an open space, no doors. There is just a tern chain of command. It's a friendly place. It is not bossy at all. We don't want people to feel they at work. It is more creative and productive that way.</p>

          <button class="accordion-red">Are you hiring students?</button>
          <div class="panel"><p> <b>Jean.</b> You'd be surprised. We are more into hiring students than established designers. For programming, it's imperative that we hire professionals. Students are more eager to progress and learn. In general, we are for diversity of experiences.</p>

          <button class="accordion-red">Is it possible to be able to make money and do good work at the same time?</button>
          <div class="panel"><p> <b>Jean.</b> My entourage always had that problem with me. At a certain time, my focus was never to make money. I design because it matters to me. Until now, my priority isn't the money. My focus is good design. It all depends on your goals because design is a form of art. It always comes with passion before the money. As a student, I would focus more on creating good work. </p>
              <p>On the other hand, it is possible. It just comes with consequences. Now, I'm doing both.</p>
