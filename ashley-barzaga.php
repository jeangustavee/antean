<b>If you were to create a slogan for your life, what would it be and why?</b><br>
â€œCreative clutter is better than idle neatness." In my younger years I often felt like I had to hold back with my art and passions, and as I grow as a person, I want to be able to foster my art uninhibited, even if it leaves a bit of a colorful trail!<br>

<b>Describe your typical work day.</b><br>
I take a long time to wake up, so I'll get up early and get some coffee and breakfast while taking out the family dog. I'll then head in to Antean, where I get to work on various creative projects for the local community. When I get home, I often help my parents around the house or run miscellaneous errands if I'm not running off to my part time job. We always eat a big family dinner together, and I try to relax with my brother or parents after. We often catch up on shows or movies together. If I've got a lot of energy still, I'll do a light workout at home. Before sleeping, I like to check social media, and maybe do a few drawings to wind down for the day. With that and my nightly skincare routine the day is over!<br>
