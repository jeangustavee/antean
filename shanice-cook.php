<b>What do you do in your spare time?</b><br>
I love sleeping and cuddling with my puppy. If we aren’t relaxing we are playing some kind of game or learning a new trick. <br><br>

<b>If you were to create a slogan for your life, what would it be and why?</b><br>
“All you gotta do is try” - I’m learning that you don’t have to succeed at everything. Everything doesn’t have to work out. But you can’t give up. You can’t run. You can’t quit. All you gotta do is try.<br><br>

<b>Describe your typical work day.</b><br>
Recently, I started waking up around 7am-ish. I get ready and take my puppy, Pinoc, on a short jog. After that we both eat and then relax until it’s time to head to Antean Studios. Once there, I work on social media and communications activities. Most of my day is spent on the computer and talking with the other team members. Kind of cool in my book. After my internship ends for the day, I head home to see my handsome baby dinosaur. We usually take a nap and then play again for a little bit. Then it’s time for me to eat and get ready for work. I wait tables for a few hours then its home to watch my shows and cuddle with Pinoc. Then bed time and it starts all over again the next day.<br><br>
