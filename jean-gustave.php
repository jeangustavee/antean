<b>Name</b><br>
The name is Jean… Jean Edouard Gustave!<br><br>
<b>School</b><br>
I went to Florida State College at Jacksonville.<br><br>
<b>Major</b><br>
My major was in Digital Multi Media Technology, but I focused a lot on Interactive Design. It's more difficult to practice and understand.<br><br>
            <b>What do you do at Antean Studios</b><br>
I’m the guy washing the floor and trying to see if I can learn a couple stuff from the talented people there.<br><br>
<b>What are your favorite apps to use?</b><br>
Slack is my number one. I love Slack because it allows us to communicate and work efficiently at the office.<br>
Now I started using Dropbox Paper more often because it is where we plan our marketing and work together.<br>
Instagram is because it's the best social app out there and it allows us to create communities through hashtags.<br>
I use Evernote to take notes when meeting with clients and laying down ideas. It's very handy and I've been using it for about 5 years now if I'm not mistaken.<br>
I rely on Adobe Capture to shape my illustrations. It's a very good app if you know how to use it.<br>
I bookmark everything from any computer and my iPhone with Pocket. I find it fascinating to have your websites bookmarked in the cloud.<br>
I read a lot and I like to learn from other people's experiences, so I use Medium for that. You won't believe how much stuff you can learn on Medium.<br>
I think I know why President Trump is always on Twitter. It's a quick and addictive way to express your mind. I'm always on twitter.

<b>What do you do in your spare time?</b><br>
I do a lot when I think I’m free. I’m always working because Antean Studios is still a baby, other than that I used to play soccer but I recently stopped because my knees no longer allow me to. I read a lot too and I spend time with my kids doing fun projects.<br><br>
<b>If you were to create a slogan for your life, what would it be and why?</b><br>
“Up and down” because it’s the pattern of my life.<br><br>
<b>Describe your typical work day.</b><br>
I wake up usually around 6. I check Antean Studios email just to make sure that nothing left behind. I check Slack to see if anyone on my team has tried to communicate with me. I plan the day for Antean Studios and add them on slack. I drop my daughter off at school then headed to Antean Studios. I usually have meetings in the morning. Once I get there, I work until it’s time to pick up my daughter at 3PM. I go back at 4 and then keep working until, maybe, 8pm or 1am. My day is very predictable.<br><br>
<b>What’s your favorite quote?</b><br>
“Make shit happen”<br><br>

<b>Reading any good books right now?</b><br>
Right now I’m reading 2 book at the same time. All Marketers Are Liars by Seth Godin and Sales and Marketing written by 3 authors.<br><br>
    <b>What’s the last thing you bought?</b><br>
    <b>I recently bought a book on Amazon entitled “The Creative Habit”.</b><br><br>
