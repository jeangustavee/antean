        <h3>Putting together your budget is the most central chapter of creating or beautifying your brand. </h3><br>
            
            <!-- featured article -->
        <p><span class="dropcap">I</span>f you have ever lived in Jacksonville, you know how challenging it is to find a good creative agency. As everyone is still on the side line freelancing—because there’s not enough jobs in the creative field—people are most likely to be misled. Being misled in finding a good agency isn’t the problem; the problem is finding the agency that fits your brand’s culture. Brand is all about culture—internal and external. It is where you expect your company to be in 10 years. Therefore, finding a creative agency that can understand that culture is imperative. From our plug, here are 3 easy ways to find a good creative agency that can fit your vision in Jacksonville.</p><br>

<p><b>Do the math</b><br>
 It is not about numbers really. Everybody is trying to sell. Sales keep the lights on. It is about your budget and finding the right company that can fit your budget. Well, a little bit more about math…<br><br>

Putting together your budget is the most central chapter of creating or beautifying your brand. It’s essential to know how much everything cost on average and how much you can put towards the project. And make sure that you understand every number flying under your eyes. </p><br>

<p><b>Find a company that can work with your budget</b> <br>
This part is risky. Finding a company that is willing to work with your budget doesn’t have to mean finding the cheapest one. It is very important to understand that. This is where you will have to look for standards and cultures. It’s always best to find a local agency that you can sit down with.</p><br>

<p><b>Set up meetings</b><br> 
Most people think finding the right creative agency is just looking at a portfolio and making a phone call. No! You have to do a lot more to save time and money. Some people have come to us at Antean Studios because they had to fire the previous agency or freelancer. It’s sort of sad because they had to pay us again to start over.</p><br>

<p>The best way to go is to visit prospective creative agencies and sit down with them to ensure they understand your position. You can also take the advantage to compare prices and what they have to offer for your money. Talk to some employees and see how they feel about working for the agency. Additionally, you can ask them to work you through their process. Ask them about how they intend to attack your project and see how confident they are when presenting their approach to you. That will sum up everything. <br><br>

In conclusion, finding and hiring the right creative agency to create or beautify your brand requires some effort on your side. The effort will be worth it when you realize that it’ll save you time and money and speed up the process at the same time. Also, keep in mind that it’s always a learning process. If you fail, start over.
