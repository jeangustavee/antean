        <p>PROPEURBS is a one-day workshop for creative entrepreneurs, small business owners and anyone looking to Spark Results. We will create a Business Plan, define your Brand, master Social Media tools and provide the right tools to raise capital for your business. 
 </p><br>

<p>The workshop is designed for the dreamers and the do-ers out there. Whether you have already started a business or blog, or you have tiny seed you’re looking to plant and develop in the years to come, this workshop is for you. Or, perhaps you’ve had a business for many years but might like to revamp and freshen up the brand.
</p><br>

<b>Here are some elements of the day:
</b><br>
 
<ul>
    <li>• Completion of a Business Plan to take home. This is essential as a framework for any business, especially when applying for grants and loans.
</li>
<li>• Collaborative and supportive work environment. Many of you will start as strangers and leave as close friends.
</li>
<li>• Great group to network with. There are typically photographers, fitness teachers, jewelry makers and bloggers at every workshop. It’s the perfect place to trade and collaborate.
</li>
<li>• Lifetime access to a private Facebook community of other former attendees to ask questions, bounce ideas and share projects.
</li>
<li>• A rock solid sense of who you are, and where you’re going. Empowering at its finest!
</li>
<li>• Tangible tools to start your business.</li>
    </ul>
