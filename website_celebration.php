        <p><dropcap>Y</dropcap>ou can choose to move slower or faster, however the time will still remain the same. It’s actually 1:35 AM. I’m writing this article to complete our website. I spent the whole weekend working on finalizing it. It was a slinky combination of coding, wine and Netflix. I worked nonstop with some occasional Netflix pauses. This combination makes creativity a bit awkward. Too much wine can make you drunk and so too much time watching Netflix can make you procrastinate. On the other hand, I have to admit that coding on a weekend can sometimes be entertaining – Excluding the pressure of meeting a deadline. At the end, it’s worth every single pixel because all objectives are satisfactorily attained.

<p>Last Saturday, around ten in the morning, I met with Marquel and Russell at Antean Studios office. The office is regularly closed on weekends, but we made an exception to finish this project. We worked all day long on the cover image for the website. We wanted visitors and potentials clients to have a festive feel at first glance. So we came up with the idea of having the A and the diamond of our logo as our main focus. They both often used as our symbols. We spent around 4 hours in cutting and assembling a 14pt cardstock to form the symbols. It was fun and challenging. We went to launch at 1:00 PM and spent the remaining 2 hours in shooting. It was quite a wonderful collaboration and an extensive reunion since we all went to college together. It was a creative attempt.

         <center><h3>&quot; Our premiere objective was to have a website with minimal<br> contents while focusing on the essentials.&quot;</h3></center>
         
<p>Later on Saturday night, I continued with editing on Photoshop. I retouched the pictures so the white can pop more and the reds to be brighter. We also have to keep in mind that this new website is essentially a modern website with a minimal aspect, but contoured with our principles. Our premiere objective was to have a website with minimal contents while focusing on the essentials. That leads us to only have six case studies in our Homepage, instead of having twenty. We don’t have a Work Page. Our works are displayed on the Homepage. Nowadays, potential clients don’t have time to browse all the projects you have done. That’s why we just showcase the ones that match the direction we are giving to our company. Subsequently, an Answers Page to answer most of the questions a client might have and a Press Page because we are about to rock the stage. The website doesn’t have a Contact Page since our contact information is displayed on our Menu Page. We are certain that no one will miss it. Most companies focus on the speed of a website without thinking of the time the visitor has to spend on a website. To say the least, a visitor can browse our website in less than 5 minutes and have a complete idea about the services we are offering. Simple is always better.

 <p>Now, the time is 3:19 AM and I’m excited to launch the website. It feels like I’m about to launch a rocket to bombard the world. We are proud of every single work we have done and hope that you come by to celebrate with us. Well, it doesn’t have to be typical party. Coffee is okay with us too so we can discuss what we can achieve together. Wouldn’t it be cool?
