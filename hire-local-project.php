        <p><b>Everything starts with a small story</b></p><br><br>
	
        <p><dropcap>A</dropcap>fter graduating from college, I decided to move to San Francisco to start a new entrepreneurial endeavor. I wasn’t sure about the outcome, but I knew my heart wanted to be there. So, I traveled to San Francisco to tangibly explore the surface. Sadly, during the third day of my visit; I got robbed. They stole everything I traveled with. I lost a lot in terms of valuables. After the robbery, I was forced to cut my trip short and travel back to Jacksonville. That trip put me, at that time, in an insipid financial situation. The next move was to find a job to cover my deficits. I, unsuccessfully, spent about two months looking for a job. 

 </p><br>
        

<p>Since I couldn’t find a job, I decided to start my own company. I pulled out some resources and managed to raise capitals to launch Antean Studios. Moreover, that new adventure gives me the opportunity to make bigger impacts in the Jacksonville business community. One of my main incentives is to only hire people in Jacksonville. Whether it’s a long or short term contract, Jacksonville based freelancers come first for my company. There is a significant need to accentuate Jacksonville local talents. If there’s one thing I’m proud of now is that, since the first day, I’ve been managing to keep every single project in Jacksonville.

</p><br><br>

         <h2>&quot; We all have at least<br> one small story to tell.&quot;</h2><br>
         
<p>After all, I still feel like there isn’t sufficient impacts as there are still people here struggling to find a job — mostly creative people. To continue the work, I’m starting a project entitled “HIRE LOCAL” that will focus on hiring local talents and sharing stories of small business owners in Jacksonville, Florida.
</p><br>
       <p>For this project I will focus on subjects that can trigger motivations from others and incite them to start hiring local talents. I want to hear from freelancers and small business owners. Participants are not limited to women, people of color, working parents, immigrants, LGBT, disabled, etc.</p><br>
       
       <p>I want to hear from folks with stories to tell and that are able to make impacts on others’ lives. I want to know what pushed you to launch your business. I want to know how you made it in Jacksonville. I want to know about your triumphs and struggles. I want to hear from your point of view of joining the movements of #hirelocalinjax.</p>
       
        <br>
         

 <p>I want to accomplish three main goals after this project: increase the local employment rates for creative entrepreneurs. I also want to increase sales for participating small business owners by encouraging people to shop local. And lastly, I want to bring attention to folks in business in Jacksonville whose stories have never been heard, considered and celebrated.
</p>

        <br>    

 <p>Portraits and interviews will be conducted at our studios mostly over the weekends. We will make arrangements for video interviews with participants at their office, shop, home and other locations.
</p>
